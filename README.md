### Who is skandilocks?

My name is Paul Bruce McIlvenny.
`Skandilocks` is an old avatar nickname coined by me back in the late 1990s.
I have an ancient, gentle `gravatar` attached to the nickname.

#### What am I up to on GitHub?

I am using GitHub more and more for a variety of software and non-software projects:
- Private team [@Big-Video](https://github.com/Big-Video) developing software for qualitative video researchers and immersive qualitative analytics.
- Public account [@BigSoftVideo](https://github.com/BigSoftVideo) for software releases and documentation.
    - We have released [AVA360VR](https://github.com/BigSoftVideo/AVA360VR) and [BreachingVR](https://github.com/Big-Video/BreachingVR) so far.
    - You can see a [rough outline of our software development plans](https://github.com/users/BigSoftVideo/projects/1).
- Public account [@QuiViRR](https://github.com/QUIVIRR) for experimental journal ([_Qualitative Video Research Reports_](https://journals.aau.dk/index.php/QUIVIRR/)).
- Using [Manubot](https://manubot.org/) for collaborative article drafting using Git, GitHub, Zotero, Pandoc etc.
    - Working on a chapter on practice-based VolCap analysis for EMCA.
    - Working on an article on practices of practical reasoning within DVCS, such as Git and GitHub.
