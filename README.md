### Who is skandilocks?

My name is Paul Bruce McIlvenny.
`Skandilocks` is an old avatar nickname invented by me back in the late 1990s.
I have an old `gravatar` attached to the nickname.

#### What am I up to on GitHub?

I am using GitHub more and more for a variety of software and non-software projects:
- Private team [@Big-Video](https://github.com/Big-Video) developing software for qualitative video researchers.
- Public account [@BigSoftVideo](https://github.com/BigSoftVideo) for software releases and documentation.
    - You can see a [rough plan of our software development](https://github.com/users/BigSoftVideo/projects/1). 
- Public account [@QuiViRR](https://github.com/QUIVIRR) for experimental journal ([Qualitative Video Research Reports](https://journals.aau.dk/index.php/QUIVIRR/)).
- Using Manubot for collaborative article drafting using Git, GitHub, Zotero, Pandoc etc.
- Personal account for private stuff.
